# Automated Definitions
A script that shows you the google definition of an input word in your python console

## Why should you use it
Saves you time as you get instant definitions on your python console so you do not have to keep alternating tabs on google and move your cursor to and from the search bar. <br>
In case you want other definitions or synonyms or antonyms of the word, you can open your google tab and the google search results are already displayed so 
you don't have to search for the word. <br>
Making a few modifications can customize the program exactly as you want it such as maybe you want a list of synonyms instead of the definition or you want the
definition based on the Part of Speech of the word in the sentence
